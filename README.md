## What is Dunder Mifflinites?

Dunder Mifflinites is a collective project centering around the idea of creating a social media platform for fans of The Office. Here users can make a profile, post to a feed of all users posts, and comment on posts. We, the creators, wanted a space where we could discuss and revel in genius of The Office... and to find other people that would enjoy our jokes and memes.
